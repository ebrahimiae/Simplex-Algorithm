# Simplex-Algorithm
Solve all kinds of linear optimization problems by simplex algorithm method
Comes with an input step to enter the problem
using BIG M method if the User Enter greater than or equal constraint
Show all simplex tables
Display all specific modes such as degeneracy and unbounded and multiple answers
